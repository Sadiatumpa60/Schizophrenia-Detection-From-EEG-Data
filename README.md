## Schizophrenia Detection From EEG Data Using Deep Learning
Schizophrenia is a chronic brain disorder. Symptoms can include delusions, hallucina-
tions, disorganized speech, trouble with thinking,and lack of motivation during Schizophre-
nia. Conventional analysis for Schizophrenia detection is mainly done by a psychiatrist
by doing various mental tests on the patients. EEG tests are also done during the period
by the doctor, but the detection is time-consuming and challenging for even experienced
doctors. Deep learning methods have opened a new door in the area of disease detec-
tion. Like all the other diseases, Schizophrenia can also be detected using deep learning
methods. This method has the potential to overcome the drawbacks of manual strategies.
As the traditional diagnostic process is complex, unreliable, and time-consuming in this
report, we are trying to develop a deep learning-based Schizophrenia detection system
using different types of Neural Networks.We have built a custom method and tested our
data set with different deep learning models like CNN, RNN etc. Among all the models
we have achieved 82% accuracy for ANN. This is the highest accuracy for any existing
approaches or models in the particular data set.
